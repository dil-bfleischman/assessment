<h1>Description:</h1>

<p>The task is to create a UI (be it either a pure rails view rendered from the backend, or any frontend rendered page) which has an input box and a search button.</p>

<p>Upon pressing the button, it queries movies using the value of the input, using the backend you build.</p>

<p>The backend may forward the query to an external api (if it doesn't have the answer) and displays the results in a list.</p>

<p>Our subscription limits how many requests we are allowed to send to the 3rd party API. If that limit exceeded, we will be overcharged, so we build a server which only forward users request if the,
query is not in its cache.</p>

<p>Some backend code stub already prepared in <a href="./lib/movies_client.rb">lib/movies_client.rb</a> for the project.
While building the application, integrate this file in your solution and implement the core logic in it.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<ul>
<li>The backend is implemented in ruby</li>
<li>Any ruby based framework can be used, if needed</li>
<li>Any datastore can be used (flat file, SQL, No-SQL, etc)</li>
<li>Access to the <a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies">"The Movie Database - registration required"</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When you have finished your work, upload the code to any code hosting site (Bitbucket, Github, Gitlab, etc) and provide us with link.</p>

<p>Simpler is better! Focus on them problem add additional features only, if you sure it is a good fit.</p>

<h1>High level workflow:</h1>

<h2>Sending Requests:</h2>

<p>The UI (from the browser) sends request to the backend.</p>

<h2>Processing the request:</h2>

<p>The query consist the search term and optionally the current page.</p>

<p>The backend checks if the same query has received within 2 mins and the results are already saved in its datastore?</p>

<ol>
<li>If not, it forwards the request to 3rd party API:
<ul>
<li>Fetch movies matching the query: The API is <a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies">"The Movie Database - registration required"</a>.</li>
<li>Save the search and its results in a datastore:
<ul>
<li>Results returned by The Movie Database API</li>
<li>Set cache hit count to 0</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: For the first not cached render the counter should stay 0</p>

<ol>
<li>If yes:
If the same keyword(s) are looked up within 2 mins:
<ul>
<li>Serve directly by the backend, no API request should be sent to the 3rd party API.</li>
<li>Record cache hit count should be incremented by 1</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: The counter is very important the necessary server resources will be calculated based on it.</p>

<p>Display results</p>

<p>Indicate to the user on the UI, whether results are fetched from our server or from the 3rd party API (display a small notice somewhere on the screen)</p>

<h2>Pagination</h2>

<p>The results should be paginated if more than 20 items returned by the query, otherwise pagination elements should not displayed.</p>

<h2>UI mockup</h2>

<h1>Bonus</h1>

<ul>
<li>Nice UI</li>
<li>Give user feedback what's happening (progress indicators)</li>
<li>Handle errors between our and the remote API service (eg: the server cannot access the 3rd party API, because of network issues)</li>
<li>Write tests</li>
<li>Deploy the application</li>
<li>Think about future improvements</li>
</ul>
